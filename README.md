#### Description:

Embark on a cinematic journey with Movie Tracker, my very own passion project. This simple yet powerful Flask web application seamlessly blends the realms of movies and technology, providing users with an immersive experience in tracking and displaying movie releases based on their selected genres.

At the heart of Movie Tracker lies its intuitive and user-friendly design. The application harnesses the power of a SQLite database to store essential movie information while seamlessly integrating with The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch additional details. This dynamic synergy ensures that users have access to a comprehensive and up-to-date catalog of their favorite films.

Begin your exploration by selecting a preferred genre from the application's intuitive dropdown menu. Whether you lean towards action-packed adventures, heartwarming dramas, or mind-bending sci-fi, Movie Tracker caters to diverse tastes. A simple click on the "Get Movies" button sets the wheels in motion, initiating the retrieval and display of movie releases tailored specifically to your chosen genre.

The magic of Movie Tracker goes beyond a mere display of titles and dates. With meticulous attention to detail, the displayed movies are organized in ascending order based on their release dates, providing a clean and structured presentation that enhances the overall user experience.

Behind the scenes, Movie Tracker is powered by a robust tech stack. Python forms the backbone, while Flask, a versatile web framework, orchestrates the seamless interaction between the application and users. The SQLite database ensures efficient storage and retrieval of movie data, while The Movie Database (TMDb) API acts as a dynamic source of additional information.
